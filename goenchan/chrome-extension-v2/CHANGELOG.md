## [2.16.0] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **Bulk Crawler "Too many subrequests" errors 99% eliminated**
  - Root cause: Cloudflare's 50 subrequest limit applies PER WORKER INVOCATION (not concurrent)
  - Previous: 50 URLs/batch × 20 requests/site = 1000 total requests → exceeded limit on 3rd site
  - New hybrid approach: 3 URLs/batch × 16 requests/site = 48 total requests < 50 limit ✓
  - Reduced MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SITE from 20 to 16
  - Reduced BATCH_SIZE from 50 to 3
  - Optimized crawling: 12 direct paths + 1 homepage + 3 contact links = 16 requests max
  - Result: Error rate 100% → 0.96% (258 errors → 2 errors in 208 URLs)
- **Bulk Crawler hanging fixed**
  - Worker: Reduced site timeout from 60s to 20s (faster failure detection)
  - Frontend: Added 90s batch timeout with AbortController (prevents infinite waiting)
  - Math: 3 sites × 20s timeout = 60s max per batch + 30s buffer

### Improved
- **Success rate dramatically improved: 0% → 16.3%**
  - Test: 208 URLs processed, 34 successful mappings found (16.3% success rate)
  - Remaining 2 "Too many subrequests" errors (0.96%) are edge cases with redirect chains

### Changed
- Bulk crawler now processes 3 sites per batch (slower but 99% reliable)
- Level 2 links reduced from 5 to 3 for better subrequest budget management
- Site timeout reduced from 60s to 20s for faster processing

## [2.15.0] - 2026-02-04

### Improved
- **Truly Unique Historical Narratives**: Each company gets a completely unique story
  - Combines multiple unique elements per company: founding year context, specific initiatives, unique strengths, philosophy, president message
  - Varies narrative structure based on available data (not single template)
  - Removes generic phrases like "長く支持される事業の基盤となる" that appeared for all companies
  - Example 1: "創業1950年から続く伝統と技術。地域に根ざした誠実な対応。それこそが東京の製造業として歩み続ける道である"
  - Example 2: "品質へのこだわり。そしてお客様との信頼関係の構築。これらが選ばれる理由となっている"
  - Example 3: "技術革新と人の心を大切にするという信念を貫き、お客様一人ひとりに向き合い続けることで、揺るぎない信頼を築いている"
  - Historical figures now read and sing truly unique content tailored to each company's character
